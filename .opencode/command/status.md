description: "Audit project progress against PRD.md"

1. Read @PRD.md and @TODO.md and identify all 'pending' tasks (empty checkboxes).
2. Scan the @backend and @frontend directories to see which of those tasks have code implementations.
3. Provide a summary of:
   - What is **Done** (but not checked in PRD).
   - What is **In Progress**.
   - What is **Next**.
4. Offer to update the PRD checkboxes based on your findings.
