1. **Context Check**: Read @PRD.md and @TODO.md to understand current progress.
2. **Analysis**: Evaluate the user's new idea based on:
   - **Technical Feasibility**: Does it fit with the current stack?
   - **User Value**: How does it improve the app? Does it fit the app scope?
   - **Complexity**: Is it a "Quick Win" or a "Major Milestone"?
3. **Structured Response**:
   - Summarize the idea.
   - List 3 Pros and 2 potential Pitfalls.
   - Outline a 3-step implementation plan.
4. **Conclusion**: Ask the user: "Should I add this to the Backlog in TODO.md?"
